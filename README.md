# Shader Grammar

**v0.1** — an ontology of shared optical primitives.

Materials are recipes. Recipes bind a closed catalog of operators
(thin-film interference, multilayer Bragg stacks, diffraction gratings,
dielectric and conductor Fresnel, microfacet scatter, Snell refraction,
caustic transport, volume scattering / absorption / emission) to typed
parameters and fields. They do not set `oilSlick: true`.

If oil slick, soap film, nacre, labradorite, butterfly structural color,
holographic foil, bismuth oxide, molten chrome, caustic water, cloud,
nebula, and opalescent glass can all be described without inventing a
one-off concept for each, the ontology is beginning to generalize rather
than cataloguing effects. That is the v0.1 acceptance test, and it passes.

## Why this exists

Shader libraries accumulate named looks. Aether (archived) was an
iridescent GLSL gallery — beautiful, and a dead end as an ontology,
because each look was a product. Seed Loom's Visual Grammar Engine
extracts motifs and palettes; it does not know what a nanometer of
optical path is.

Shader Grammar sits under both. A renderer, a lookdev tool, or an agent
should be able to say *this is a two-interface film with thickness field
X and IOR stack (1.0, 1.47, 1.333)* and get oil-on-water without a
preset named oil.

## Package

```
schemas/
  parameter.schema.json
  field.schema.json
  operator.schema.json
  recipe.schema.json
taxonomy/material-taxonomy.yaml
catalog/operators.json          closed set of 13 operators
recipes/*.json                  12 specimen recipes
examples/valid/                 positive control
examples/invalid/               named-effect trap (must fail)
docs/ontology-gaps.md
reports/validation-report.md    generated
tools/validate.mjs
```

## The trap this version exists to refuse

```json
{ "id": "oil-slick", "oilSlick": true }
```

is illegal. The legal form binds `thin-film-interference` with a
thickness field and three real IORs, then reuses `caustic-transport`
for the water underneath — the same operators soap film, bismuth oxide,
and caustic water bind with different numbers.

## Validate

```sh
node tools/validate.mjs
```

The gate is stronger than schema-valid:

1. Every recipe validates against `recipe.schema.json`.
2. Every operator validates and declares `reusable: true`.
3. No material-named keys or effect booleans.
4. All twelve specimens are present.
5. **Every catalog operator is used by at least two specimens.**
6. The named-effect anti-example is rejected.
7. The minimal thin-film example is accepted.

## Lineage

- **aether** (archived) — iridescent GLSL product. Ancestor look, not ancestor ontology.
- **seed-loom** — signal-to-system pipeline and Visual Grammar Engine. Pointer lives in `docs/SHADER_GRAMMAR.md` there.
- **prism-loom / omni-loom** — fabrication and prismatic cousins; they consume looks, they should not define them.
